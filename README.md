# Project 4: PIEKEA
## Overview
My final project on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course in a pair project with Penelope. We created a Python Django API with a React front end. Multiple relationships were used in the product designed with an Entity Relationship Diagram. The inital idea came from creating an ecommerce company which then took the spinoff from the multinational company IKEA but for pies. The implementation then came about when creating a customizable/assembled pie that a user makes when going to shop at IKEA, instead it will be PIEKEA.
# PIE-KEA
